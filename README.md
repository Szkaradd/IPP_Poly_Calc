# IPP_Poly_Calc

Program Description

This year's major task involves implementing operations on sparse multivariable polynomials.

In the first part of the task, operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation of the polynomial value at point x_0 were implemented. The implementation consists of poly.c and poly.h files.

The second part of the task involved implementing a calculator that performs operations on sparse multivariable polynomials.

In the third part, the operation of composing a polynomial was to be implemented, corresponding to the command of the calculator. In addition, the PolyOwnMonos and PolyCloneMonos functions were implemented.
